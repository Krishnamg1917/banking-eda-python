# 🏦 Banking Loan EDA - Python

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on banking loan data to understand customer demographics, financial patterns, and risk factors. The goal was to uncover insights that can improve **loan approval strategies, customer segmentation, and risk management** for financial institutions.  

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights  
- 🔗 **Data Extraction**: Connected to **MySQL database** and imported the `banking_case.banking` table into Pandas.  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Transformation**:  
  - Handled missing values and irrelevant columns.  
  - Created **Income Bands** (Low, Medium, High) using custom bins.  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Analyzed demographic factors like **Gender, Nationality, Occupation, Age, Loyalty, Properties Owned**.  
  - Studied financial indicators like **Estimated Income, Credit Cards, Fee Structure, Risk Weighting**.  
- 📈 **Visualizations**: Built **countplots, histograms, and distributions** to uncover behavioral patterns.  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- **Income Bands**: Majority of customers fell into **Low–Medium income groups**, impacting creditworthiness.  
- **Occupation Trends**: Specific roles (e.g., Sales Executives, Technicians) were overrepresented in risk categories.  
- **Credit Behavior**: Number of credit cards and loyalty classification strongly influenced **risk weighting**.  
- **Demographics**: Age and Nationality distributions showed distinct variations in loan approvals.  
- **Risk Factor**: Customers with **lower income and 1–3 years tenure** showed higher default tendencies.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL (MySQL)**: Data extraction & integration  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Power Query logic (applied in Pandas)  
- **EDA Techniques**: Segmentation, categorical/numerical analysis, risk profiling

## ✅ Outcome  
The analysis provided a clear understanding of **demographic and financial factors driving loan risk**. Key findings like **low-income groups and specific occupations being high-risk segments** can help banks design:  
- Smarter **loan approval models**  
- Better **customer segmentation**  
- Improved **risk-weighting strategies**
